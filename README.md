# ToDoList
This is a to-do list application:clipboard: written in React and TypeScript.

In order to practice using SCSS in a frontend project, I try to revise CSS code in my previous project.
My previous project [HERE]<https://github.com/YingChenCheng/ToDoList1>

To run this project at the first time, please run `npm i && start` which `i` stands for install.

Afterwards, you can run `npm start` directly.
